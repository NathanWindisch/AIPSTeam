1. Remove any remaining HTML entities (e.g., &nbsp;, &amp;, &#39;) and replace them with their appropriate characters.
2. Eliminate excessive blank lines, reducing multiple consecutive blank lines to a single blank line for paragraph separation.

6. Ensure proper capitalization at the beginning of sentences.
7. Remove any repeated words that might have resulted from improper tag removal.
8. Preserve intentional line breaks for items like addresses or poetry, but remove unnecessary line breaks within paragraphs.
9. If you encounter any lists, ensure they are formatted consistently with appropriate indentation or numbering.
10. Correct any obvious spelling errors that may have resulted from improper character encoding.
